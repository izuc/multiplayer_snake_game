The project was done for an assignment in 2009. The idea was to create a multiplayer "snake" game, that used Java Applets for the clients; both clients once joined in a game would exchange the internal game information via an object stream to the server (running Java Server Pages) that would send to the other client.

The website allows browsing through the players, and requesting a battle; which shows on the other users (via ajax). The client can then 'accept' the battle request, which will then take the client into the game whilst also taking the other player. This is done by when the first player requested a battle, it will then grab the other users session (based on their user id) and pass in a value. The clients are constantly ajax polling the server for any requests being accepted (checking the session) and when a request has been accepted, it will then redirect the user using JavaScript to the game.
